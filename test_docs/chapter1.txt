1. Nature
The forest was unusually quiet that morning, with only the soft rustle of leaves breaking the silence. Sunlight filtered gently through the tall canopy, creating golden patches that danced on the forest floor. A distant woodpecker tapped at a tree, and a squirrel scurried along a branch, pausing now and then to sniff the air. Everything felt still, as if the world were holding its breath.
