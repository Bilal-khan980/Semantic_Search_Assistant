# üìÑ Testing PDF Text Capture

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Window Focus Problem**: System now detects when hotkey is pressed from our own window and ignores it
2. **PDF Optimization**: Extended delays and multiple attempts for Adobe Reader
3. **Better Error Messages**: PDF-specific troubleshooting tips

## üéØ **Proper Testing Steps:**

### Step 1: Start Your System
```bash
start_enhanced_admin.bat
```

### Step 2: Test in Adobe Reader
1. **Open Adobe Reader** with your PDF
2. **Select text in the PDF** (drag with mouse to highlight)
3. **Make sure Adobe Reader window is active** (click on it)
4. **Press Ctrl+Alt+H** while Adobe Reader is focused
5. **Should capture the PDF text** (not the monitor window text)

### Step 3: If It Still Shows Monitor Text
This means the hotkey is being triggered while the monitor window is focused. To fix:

1. **Click on Adobe Reader** to make it the active window
2. **Select your text in Adobe Reader**
3. **Don't click back to the monitor window**
4. **Press Ctrl+Alt+H while Adobe Reader is still active**

## üö® **Common Issues:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Shows monitor text | Hotkey pressed while monitor window focused | Click on Adobe Reader first |
| No text captured | PDF copy protection | Try right-click ‚Üí Copy manually |
| Text too short error | Selection lost | Select text and immediately press hotkey |
| Timing issues | PDF needs more time | System now waits up to 1.7 seconds |

## üîß **What the Fix Does:**

1. **Detects Our Own Windows**: 
   ```python
   if self._is_our_own_window(window_title):
       logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping copy from our own window")
       return ""
   ```

2. **Ensures Proper Focus**:
   ```python
   win32gui.SetForegroundWindow(hwnd)
   time.sleep(0.2)
   ```

3. **PDF-Optimized Timing**:
   ```python
   delay = 0.5 + (attempt * 0.3)  # Up to 1.7 seconds
   ```

## üìù **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Start system with `start_enhanced_admin.bat`
- [ ] Open PDF in Adobe Reader
- [ ] Click on Adobe Reader window to focus it
- [ ] Select text in PDF (should be highlighted)
- [ ] Press Ctrl+Alt+H while Adobe Reader is focused
- [ ] Should capture PDF text (not monitor text)

The key is making sure **Adobe Reader is the active window** when you press the hotkey!
