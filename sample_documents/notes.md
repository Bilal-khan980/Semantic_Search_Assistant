# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.

**Examples:**
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with data without labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and structure from the data.

**Examples:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

**Examples:**
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
